<p align="justify" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: Raleway;">A complete description of ARM ISA is available&nbsp;<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp" style="box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #337ab7; text-decoration: none; outline: 0px;">here</a>. The syntax rules and directives you have to follow while writting ARM programs is very similar to that of GNU ARM assembler conventions. The list of assembler directives that our simulator supports are available in the&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">help</span>section of the simulator. An assembly program typically contains a&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">data</span>&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">section</span>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">text section</span>. In the data section memory for global variables and static local variables would be allocated. In the text section, the actual sequence of instructions reside. Finally there will be a program stack for which no explicit declaration is necessary. Program stack is useful for allocating memory to local variables and handling procedure calls. Sample programs to get started with, are available as a part of the simulator.</p>
