<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: Raleway;">Many scientific applications involve computations involving just not integers but also real numbers. In computers we cannot precisely represent all of the real numbers. However we can still have a useful and effective representation of them with certain loss in precision.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: Raleway;">In this lab we shall understand the basic concepts of Floating Point Numbers and their conversion to and from decimal form.</p>
